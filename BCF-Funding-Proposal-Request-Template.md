Resources include our team. BitDetroit has a working relationship with several businesses in the City already. BitDetroit has been promoting cryptocurrency adoption in the city for over a year.

**Timeline:** 

The timeline for this project has a date to be determined, estimated at january 13th. The poster campaign will have a deadline of january 5th, allowing students the time to work on it during school break. We are currently working out a time with TechTown Detroit for the Cash is King Conference.


**Goals:**

The goals of this project are three fold. First, a small poster campaign will be launched, with designs coming from local high school and college students. This creates interest and something to talk about over christmas break with parents and relatives. Secondly, a cold pitch approach to inviting businesses will be used to garner support and interest. This includes visiting in person, and inviting them to the conference. At this time we will gather any questions they have, and find the answers before the conference. Thirdly, the conference will act as a launch point, with a presentation on what Bitcoin Cash is, and what it can do for the businesses that choose to accept it. The question and answer session that follows will be prepared for, with proper answers, links, and support.

This project aims to reach over 10,000 people directly, with participants showing up numbering between 150 and 200. The main focus will be on business implementation however I expect that due to the exposure, many individuals will come as well.


**Other:**

The information obtained from this project will be disseminated and used to create better and more effective conferences. Ideally, any Bitcoin Cash enthusiast should be able to obtain a copy of frequently the encountered questions and their answers from the conference. Networking businesses to a support circle is another aim. We will create a mailing list that every attendee can be linked to, regarding support and updates. Representing Bitcoin Cash accurately is important. Our conference will recorded, and hopefully used as a template going forward.

## Use S.M.A.R.T Principles When writing the BCF FPR

**S** - **Specific** - Well defined. Clear to anyone that has a basic knowledge of the project

**M** - **Measurable** - Know if the goal is obtainable. Find out when you have achieved your goal

**A** - **Agreed Upon** - Agreement with all the stakeholders what the goals should be.

**R** - **Realistic** - Within the availability of resources, knowledge and time.

**T** - **Time-bound** - Enough time to achieve the goal. Not too much time, which can affect project performance


## BCF FPR Requirements

- A completed FPR must be included as to a project's github repo as the first commit/PR as an md file. This will help guide the project, and anyone who joins it can quickly find out the most important information.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 40mm must have the BCF round logo on it somewhere.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 100mm must have the logos of our Tier 3 sponsors on it somewhere.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include the BCF Bitcoin Cash animation at the beginning or end of the video.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include our tier 2 and tier 3 sponsors at the end of the video.
- The BCF reserves the right to not fund any project at it's own discretion.

## What isn't the Bitcoin Cash Fund for.

- Funds will not be given to companies just to further their business. Companies are welcome to submit an FPR as long as it is for a specific project that attempts to directly increase awareness and adoption of Bitcoin Cash.
- Funds will not be paid to individuals or businesses simply because they want money.
- Funds will not be paid for BCH protocol development (at this time).
